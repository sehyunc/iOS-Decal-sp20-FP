# Final Project for iOS Decal Spring 2020
## Proposal
Our team proposes an app that will help the long standing issue of music at parties. To replace a central DJ, or a person using their phone and accepting song requests from everyone, we will make an app that will allow users to queue songs using their own phones to a playlist that is played throughout the party.
