# Final Project for iOS Decal Spring 2020
All of the final project files can be found in v2
## Initial Setup
- run ```pod install```
- get authotization token from https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user-top-artists-and-tracks/?type=artists&time_range=&limit=&offset=
- copy and paste token into the Spartan.authorization field in finalProject/MainScreeenViewController.swift
- run project and see your stats and recommendations!
## Notes
While I admit this may seem like a barebonees project, we believe it has potential and are motivated to continue working on it even after this Decal ends. Some additional features we would like to add are:
- user login to bypass the need for an OAuth token
- being able to choose between 4 week, 2 month, and 6 month periods for stats
- including links to all UILabels, so that the user will be redirected to the Spotify page
While there are a many things we couldn't do currently, learning how to use the API and building our own project from scratch was a great learning experience, and it really made us apply eeverything we've learned throughout the course of the Decal.
## Proposal
Our team proposes an app that will help the long standing issue of music at parties. To replace a central DJ, or a person using their phone and accepting song requests from everyone, we will make an app that will allow users to queue songs using their own phones to a playlist that is played throughout the party.
